# PiTrainer

Main reason for this one-day project was that the following page for memorizing Pi:

[https://www.piday.org/pi-quiz/]()

did not offer a feature to practice digits further down the line.

If i want to repeat a given set of digits, i have to enter all of the previous in order to get to my favored starting point.

So with this project, i can choose where i want to start while retaining the benefit of getting instant feedback of whether my memorization was correct.
